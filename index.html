			<h2>About</h2>
			<!--<hr/ class="centerLine">-->
			<p>I am currently an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from The University of Arizona in Dec. 2010. I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electronic Engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Communication and Information Systems from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2003. Before joining Auburn, I have worked as an assistant professor for 5 years in the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. Prior to Oakland, I was a senior engineer in Qualcomm Atheros Inc. from Dec. 2010 to Aug. 2011.</p>
			<br>
			<p id="note">I'm always looking for highly self-motivated Ph.D. students who are interested in doing research in the areas of networking and security to join my group. Visiting scholars and students are also welcome. Please <a href="https://eng.auburn.edu/users/tzs0058/opportunities.htm">view this page for oppurtunities</a>.</p>
